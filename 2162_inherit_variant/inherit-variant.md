# Revision History

Since [@P2162R1], adjusted the wording based on Tomasz KamiÅ„ski's suggestion.

Since [@P2162R0], added more information in the implementation experience section.

# Introduction

[@LWG3052] describes an under-specification to `std::visit`:

>  the _Requires_ element imposes no explicit requirements on the types in `Variant`s. Notably, the `Variant`s are not required to be `variant`s. This lack of constraints appears to be simply an oversight. 

The original proposal [@P0088R3] makes no mention of other kinds of of variants besides `std::variant`, and this does not appear to have been discussed in LEWG. 

The proposed resolution in the library issue is to make `std::visit` only work if all of the `Variant`s are, in fact, `std::variant`s:

> _Remarks_: This function shall not participate in overload resolution unless `remove_cvref_t<Variants@~i~@>` is a specialization of `variant` for all `0 <= i < n`.

This paper suggests a different direction. Instead of restricting to _just_ `std::variant` (and certainly not wanting to go all out and design a "variant-like" interface), this paper proposes to allow an additional category of useful types to be `std::visit()`-ed: those that publicly and unambiguously inherit from a specialization of `std::variant`.

# Inheriting from `variant`

There are two primary motivators for inheriting from `std::variant`.

One is to simply extend functionality. If we're using `variant` to represent a state machine, we may want additional operations that are relevant to our state that `variant` doesn't itself provide:

```cpp
struct State : variant<Disconnected, Connecting, Connected>
{
    using variant::variant;
    
    bool is_connected() const {
        return std::holds_alternative<Connected>(*this);
    }
    
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, State const&) {
        // ...
    }
};
```

Another may be to create a recursive variant, as in the example from [@P1371R2]:

```cpp
struct Expr;

struct Neg {
    std::shared_ptr<Expr> expr;
};

struct Add {
    std::shared_ptr<Expr> lhs, rhs;
};

struct Mul {
    std::shared_ptr<Expr> lhs, rhs;
};

struct Expr : std::variant<int, Neg, Add, Mul> {
    using variant::variant;
};

namespace std {
    template <> struct variant_size<Expr> : variant_size<Expr::variant> {};
    
    template <std::size_t I> struct variant_alternative<I, Expr> : variant_alternative<I, Expr::variant> {};
}
```

That paper even has an example of passing an `Expr` to `std::visit()` directly, a use-case that this paper is seeking to properly specify. It would be pretty
nice if that just worked.

Note also that the example includes an explicit specialization of `variant_size` and `variant_alternative` that just forward along to `Expr`'s base class. These specializations are pure boilerplate - they basically have to look the way they do, so they don't really offer much in the way of adding value to the program.

# Implementation Approach

The proposed resolution of LWG3052 is to, basically, add this constraint onto
`std::visit`:

```cpp
template <typename Visitor, typename... Variants>
    requires (is_specialization_of_v<remove_cvref_t<Variants>, variant> && ...)
constexpr decltype(auto) visit(Visitor&&, Variants&&) {
    // as today
}
```

This paper proposes instead that `visit` conditionally upcasts all of its incoming variants to `std::variant` specializations:

```cpp
template <typename Visitor, typename... Variants>
    requires (is_specialization_of_v<remove_cvref_t<Variants>, variant> && ...)
constexpr decltype(auto) visit(Visitor&&, Variants&&) {
    // as today
}

template <typename... Ts>
constexpr auto variant_cast(std::variant<Ts...>& v) -> std::variant<Ts...>& {
    return v;
}
template <typename... Ts>
constexpr auto variant_cast(std::variant<Ts...> const& v) -> std::variant<Ts...> const& {
    return v;
}
template <typename... Ts>
constexpr auto variant_cast(std::variant<Ts...>&& v) -> std::variant<Ts...>&& {
    return std::move(v);
}
template <typename... Ts>
constexpr auto variant_cast(std::variant<Ts...> const&& v) -> std::variant<Ts...> const&& {
    return std::move(v);
}

template <typename Visitor, typename... Variants>
constexpr decltype(auto) visit(Visitor&& vis, Variants&&... vars) {
    return visit(std::forward<Visitor>(vis),
        variant_cast(std::forward<Variants>(vars))...);
}
```

This means the body of `std::visit` for implementations can remain unchanged -
it, as today, can just assume that all the variants are indeed `std::variant`s. Such an implementation would allow visitation of the `State` and `Expr` examples provided earlier.

Now, this means we can `std::visit` a variant that we can't even invoke `std::get` or `std::get_if` on, such as with this delightful type courtesy of Tim Song:

```cpp
struct MyEvilVariantBase {
    int index;
    char valueless_by_exception;
};

struct MyEvilVariant : std::variant<int, long>, std::tuple<int>, MyEvilVariantBase { };
```

But... who cares. Don't write types like that.

# Implementation Experience

The Microsoft STL implementation already supports exactly this design [@stlstl] since the first Visual Studio 2019 release in April 2019. 

The libc++ implementation has supported _nearly_ this design since day one [@libcpp]. While the incoming variants to `visit` are upcast to specializations of `std::variant`, the member function `valueless_by_exception()` is invoked directly on the arguments. The spirit of the implementation matches the intent of this paper, though it does technically break on Tim's example (but does work fine on any types that inherit from `std::variant` without touching `valueless_by_exception()` -- and it's just the `valueless_by_exception` member that causes the problem, the `index` member doesn't).

When I pointed out to Tim that libc++'s variant only breaks for absurd types that do things like have a member named `valueless_by_exception`, he followed up by providing a different absurd type that instead breaks by inheriting from `std::type_info`:

```cpp
struct MyEvilVariant : std::variant<int, long>, std::type_info { };
using x = decltype(std::visit([](auto){},     // error for libc++
    std::declval<MyEvilVariant>()));          // ambiguous look on __impl
```

The libstdc++ implementation used to support visiting inheriting variants in gcc 8, but then stopped supporting them in gcc 9 - only because its check for whether the variant can be never valueless only works for `std::variant` specializations directly [@libstdcpp]. I filed a bug report [@gcc.90943] to get them to start supporting again, but that bug report has been suspended pending the resolution of the library issue in question.

Boost.Variant supports visiting inherited `variant`s. Boost.Variant2 will start supporting visiting inherited `variant`s in Boost 1.74. [@boost.variant2].

# Wording

Change [variant.visit]{.sref}:

::: bq
```diff
template<class Visitor, class... Variants>
  constexpr see below visit(Visitor&& vis, Variants&&... vars);
template<class R, class Visitor, class... Variants>
  constexpr R visit(Visitor&& vis, Variants&&... vars);
```

::: addu
[-2]{.pnum} Let _`as-variant`_ denote the exposition-only function templates


```cpp
template<class... Ts>
auto&& @_as-variant_@(variant<Ts...>& var) { return var; }
template<class... Ts>
auto&& @_as-variant_@(const variant<Ts...>& var) { return var; }
template<class... Ts>
auto&& @_as-variant_@(variant<Ts...>&& var) { return std::move(var); }
template<class... Ts>
auto&& @_as-variant_@(const variant<Ts...>&& var) { return std::move(var); }
```


Let _`n`_ be `sizeof...(Variants)`. For each `0 <= i < n`, let _`V@~i~@`_ denote
the type `decltype(@_as-variant_@(std::forward<Variants@~i~@>(vars@~i~@)))`.

[-1]{.pnum} _Constraints_: _`V@~i~@`_ is a valid type for all `0 <= i < n`.

[0]{.pnum} Let _`V`_ denote the pack of types _`V@~i~@`_.
::: 

[1]{.pnum} [Let `n` be `sizeof...(Variants)`.]{.rm}
Let [`m`]{.rm} [_`m`_]{.addu} [Italicize `m` throughout]{.ednote} be a pack of `n` values of type `size_t`.
Such a pack is [called]{.rm} valid if `0 <= m@~i~@ < variant_size_v<remove_reference_t<@[Variants~i~]{.rm} [_V~i~_]{.addu}@>>` for all `0 <= i < n`.
For each valid pack _`m`_, let _`e(m)`_ denote the expression:

```diff
- INVOKE(std::forward<Visitor>(vis), get<m>(std::forward<Variants>(vars))...) // see [func.require]
+ INVOKE(std::forward<Visitor>(vis), get<m>(std::forward<@_V_@>(vars))...) // see [func.require]
```

for the first form and

```diff
- INVOKE<R>(std::forward<Visitor>(vis), get<m>(std::forward<Variants>(vars))...) // see [func.require]
+ INVOKE<R>(std::forward<Visitor>(vis), get<m>(std::forward<@_V_@>(vars))...) // see [func.require]
```

for the second form.

[2]{.pnum} _Mandates_: For each valid pack `m`, `e(m)` is a valid expression.
All such expressions are of the same type and value category.

[3]{.pnum} _Returns_: `e(m)`, where `m` is the pack for which `m@~i~@` is [`vars@~i~@.index()`]{.rm} [`@_as-variant_@(vars@~i~@).index()`]{.addu} for all `0 <= i < n`. The return type is `decltype(e(m))` for the first form.

[4]{.pnum} _Throws_: `bad_variant_access` if [any `variant` in `vars` is `valueless_by_exception()`]{.rm} [`(@_as-variant_@(vars).valueless_by_exception() || ...)` is `true`]{.addu}. 

[5]{.pnum} _Complexity_: For `n <= 1`, the invocation of the callable object is implemented in constant time, i.e., for `n=1`, it does not depend on the number of alternative types of [`Variants@~0~@`]{.rm} [_`V@~0~@`_]{.addu}.
For `n>1`, the invocation of the callable object has no complexity requirements.

:::

## Feature-test macro

This paper proposes to bump the value `__cpp_lib_variant`. The macro already exists, so this is, in a sense, free. And users can use the value of this macro to avoid having to specialize `variant_size` and `variant_alternative` for their inherited variants.
